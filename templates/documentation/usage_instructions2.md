# Student Usage Instructions

Welcome to your research project repository! This guide will help you understand how to use and maintain your project workspace effectively throughout your research journey.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Repository Access
You should have received an invitation to access your research repository:
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/aaivu/{INDEX_NUMBER}_{RESEARCH_AREA}`
- Check your email for the GitHub invitation
- Accept the invitation and set up your local environment

### 2. Initial Setup

#### Clone Your Repository
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/aaivu/{INDEX_NUMBER}_{RESEARCH_AREA}.git
cd {INDEX_NUMBER}_{RESEARCH_AREA}

# Set up your development environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure Git (if not already done)
```bash

├── methodology/            # Research methodology and planning
├── implementation/         # Your code and experiments
├── results/               # Experimental results and analysis
├── documentation/         # Project documentation and reports
└── paper/                # Your research paper
```

## 📚 Working with Your Project

### Project Phases and Milestones

Your project is organized around four major milestones:

1. **Literature Review** (Week 4) - 15% of grade
2. **Methodology and Implementation** (Week 8) - 20% of grade
3. **Mid-Term Evaluation** (Week 10) - 25% of grade
4. **Final Evaluation and Submission** (Week 16) - 40% of grade

### Managing Milestones

#### Tracking Progress
Each milestone has a corresponding GitHub issue that serves as:
- Progress tracking checklist
- Deliverable requirements
- Evaluation criteria
- Communication tool with supervisors

#### Working with Issues
1. **Find your milestone issues** in the Issues tab
2. **Read through requirements** carefully
3. **Use checkboxes** to track your progress
4. **Add comments** to document your work and ask questions
5. **Tag supervisors** (@supervisor) when you need feedback

### Daily Workflow

#### 1. Start Your Day
```bash
# Update your local repository
git pull origin main

# Check for any new issues or feedback
# Visit: https://github.com/aaivu/{INDEX_NUMBER}_{RESEARCH_AREA}/issues
```

#### 2. Work on Your Tasks
- Follow the project structure guidelines
- Document your work as you go
- Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages

#### 3. End Your Day
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add literature review notes for deep learning papers"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main
```

## 📊 Progress Reporting

### Weekly Progress Reports
You must submit weekly progress reports using the provided template:

1. **Create a new issue** using the "Weekly Progress Report" template
2. **Fill out all sections** honestly and thoroughly
3. **Tag your supervisor** for review
4. **Submit by end of each week**

### Milestone Submissions
For each milestone:

1. **Complete all deliverables** in the appropriate folders
2. **Update the milestone issue** with your progress
3. **Create a pull request** (if required)
4. **Tag supervisors** for review
5. **Present your work** (for major milestones)

## 💻 Development Best Practices

### Code Organization
- **Follow the project structure** outlined in `project_structure.md`
- **Use meaningful file names** and organize logically
- **Document your code** with comments and docstrings
- **Write tests** for critical functions

### Version Control Best Practices
```bash
# Make frequent, small commits
git add specific_file.py
git commit -m "Implement baseline model architecture"

# Use descriptive commit messages
git commit -m "Fix data preprocessing bug in feature extraction"

# Create branches for major features (optional but recommended)
git checkout -b feature/new-model-architecture
# ... make changes ...
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-model-architecture
```

### Code Quality
- **Follow PEP 8** style guidelines for Python
- **Use consistent naming** conventions
- **Keep functions small** and focused
- **Remove unused code** and debug statements

## 📝 Documentation Guidelines

### README Updates
Keep your main README.md updated with:
- Current project status
- Recent achievements
- Instructions for running your code
- Links to important documents

### Code Documentation
```python
def preprocess_data(raw_data, config):
    """
    Preprocess raw data according to specified configuration.
    
    Args:
        raw_data (pd.DataFrame): Raw input data
        config (dict): Preprocessing configuration parameters
        
    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Preprocessed data ready for model training
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If raw_data is empty or invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Research Documentation
- **Keep detailed notes** of your literature review
- **Document experiments** with parameters and results
- **Record insights and discoveries** as you work
- **Maintain a research journal** in your documentation folder

## 🤝 Communication with Supervisors

### Regular Communication
